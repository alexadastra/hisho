# Hisho:bird:

## What is it?

### The core

Hisho is an app to handle, automate, and analyze your day-to-day tasks. Concepts were inherited from [Jedi Techniques](https://procrastinatology.com/) and other time managment and personal effectiveness books. Currently you can use the service via Telegram Bot, but the complete mobile application is planning.

### The stack

- Go
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Github Actions 
- Helm
- Kubernetes

## How to use it?

Currently there's no solution to start up the whole monorepo. Go to each service folder and run with Makefile according README.
